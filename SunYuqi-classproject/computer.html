            <p>Computer science involves the theoretical basis of calculation and the actual technology of its application.</p>
            <p>Computer science is the study of processes that interact with data. These processes can be expressed as data in the form of programs. It allows the use of algorithms to manipulate, store and transmit digital information. A computer scientist studies calculation theory and the practice of designing software systems.</p>
